# 🗑️ Trash Classification Models: CNN from Scratch and ResNet50
# ✨ Introduction
This repository is part of my internship test at Adamata for the AI Engineer role. The task was to classify trash images into six categories: paper, glass, plastic, metal, cardboard, and trash.

Dataset: 
5.05K+ images
paper 23.5%
glass 19.8%
plastic 19.1%
metal 16.2%
cardboard 15.9%
trash 5.4%

However, I decided to implement two different models to compare their performance:

1. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch.
2. A ResNet50 model fine-tuned using transfer learning.
   
From these 2 models, I have explored the tradeoffs as well. The dataset used for this task is the TrashNet dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/garythung/trashnet).
